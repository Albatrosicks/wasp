# WASP
<img src="wasp.png" width="88" alt="Logo, an abstract illustration of a wasp positioned in front of Windows PowerShell logo"> WASP is a PowerShell snapin for Windows Automation tasks like selecting windows and controls and sending mouse and keyboard events. WASP has [automation cmdlets](#automation-cmdlets) like `Select-Window`, `Select-Control`, `Send-Keys`, `Send-Click`, `Get-WindowPosition`, `Set-WindowPosition`, `Set-WindowActive`, `Remove-Window` &hellip; etc.

Its goal is to enable Windows GUI Automation scripting from inside PowerShell without resorting to specialized scripting tools. 

Just to be clear, don't expect any ["click to record" functionality](https://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/features/virtual-user.html) &hellip; but, *do* expect to be able to automatically tile windows, send mouse clicks and keystrokes, and in general, automate those tasks that you would normally not be able to do from a console.

## How to install

Download from [releases](../../releases), and extract into a PowerShell module directory (e.g., you can try, `$env:PSModulePath -split ';' | Select-Object -First 1`). Use `Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name WASP | Import-Module` to make its cmdlets available to the shell. Detailed instructions here: [How to install WASP as module in PowerShell](How_to_install_WASP_as_module_in_PowerShell.md)

 1. [Choose your module install path](How_to_install_WASP_as_module_in_PowerShell.md#step-1-choose-your-module-install-path)
 2. [Ensure DLL is in the WASP directory](How_to_install_WASP_as_module_in_PowerShell.md#step-2-ensure-dll-is-in-the-wasp-directory)
 3. [Copy WASP DLL to module path and unblock it](How_to_install_WASP_as_module_in_PowerShell.md#step-3-copy-wasp-dll-to-module-path-and-unblock-it)

## Some Usage Examples
#### Author's standard demo:

##### Open a couple windows
    notepad.exe
    explorer.exe
##### list the windows
    Select-Window | ft â€“auto
##### Activate Notepad
    Select-Window notepad* | Set-WindowActive
##### Close Explorer
    Select-Window explorer | Select -First 1 | Remove-WIndow
##### Run a few more copies of notepad
    notepad; notepad; notepad; notepad;
##### Move them around so we can see them all &hellip; (Note the use of `foreach` with the incrementation)
    $i = 1;$t = 100; Select-Window notepad | ForEach { Set-WindowPosition -X 20 -Y (($i++)*$t) -Window $_ }
##### Put some text into them &hellip;
    Select-Window notepad | Send-Keys "this is a test"
##### Close the first notepad window by pressing ALT+F4, and pressing Alt+N
###### In this case, you don't have to worry about shifting focus to the popup, because it's modal
###### THE PROBLEM with sending keys like that is:<br/>&Tab;&Tab;if there is no confirmation dialog because the file is unchanged, the Alt+N still gets sent
    Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Send-Keys "%{F4}%n"
##### Close the next notepad window &hellip; 
##### By asking nicely (Remove-Window) and then hitting "n" for "Don't Save"
##### If there are no popups, Select-ChldWindow returns nothing, and that's the end of it
    Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Remove-Window -Passthru | `
      Select-ChildWindow | Send-Keys "n"
##### Close the next notepad window the hard way 
##### Just to show off that our "Window" objects have a ProcessID and can be piped to kill
    Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | kill
##### A different way to confirm Don't Save (use CLICK instead of keyboard)
##### Notice how I dive in through several layers of Select-Control to find the button?
##### This can only work experimentally: 
##### use SPY++, or run the line repeatedly, adding "|Select-Control" until you see the one you want
    Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Remove-Window -Passthru | `
      Select-childwindow | select-control| select-control| select-control -title "Do&n't Save" | Send-Click
##### But now we have the new -Recurse parameter, so it's easy.  Just find the window you want and &hellip;
    Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Remove-Window -Passthru | `
      Select-childwindow | select-control -title "Do&n't Save"  -recurse | Send-Click

#### Author's favourite use: Re-dock all Visual Studio Tool windows

###### NOTE: 0, 0 is the resize corner, so you need to specify X,Y coordinates for the click:
    Select-Window devenv | Select-ChildWindow | Send-Click 10 10 -Double 


### Automation cmdlets
* `Select-Window` - Pick windows by process name or window caption (with wildcard support)
* `Select-ChildWindow` - Pick all owned **windows** of another window (e.g., dialogs, tool windows)
* `Select-Control` - Pick controls (children) of a specific window, by class and/or name and/or index (with wildcard support) -- NOTE: the "Window" can be specified as "-Window 0" to get all parentless windows, which includes windows, dialogs, tooltips, etc.&hellip; With **-Window 0** this returns a true superset of the Select-Window output.
* `Send-Click` - send mouse clicks (any button, with any modifier keys)
* `Send-Keys` - [Windows.Forms.SendKeys](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.sendkeys) lets you send keys &hellip; try this: `Select-Window notepad | Send-Keys "%(ea)Testing{Enter}{F5}"` (and for extra fun, try it with multiple notepad windows open).
* `Set-WindowActive` - Simply activates the window
* `Set-WindowPosition` - Set any one of (or all of) top, left, width, height on a window &hellip; or maximize/minimize/restore
* `Get-WindowPosition` - Get the position (kind-of redundant, actually, since the Window object has it's position as a property)
* `Remove-Window` - Closes the specified window
